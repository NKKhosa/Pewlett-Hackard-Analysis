## Summary: 

In total 72,458 roles will need to be filled as employees reach retirement at Pewlett-Hackard. Most notably, 36,291 employees in the Engineering department will be retiring soon. This is the department that should recieve the foremost attention. Next, 32,562 Staff and Senior Staff will be approaching retirement. Finally, 3,603 Technique Leaders and 2 Managers will be eligible for retirement.

The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is considerably smaller than the number of employees that will be retiring. For example, only 0.7% of Senior Engineers retiring are eligible for the mentorship program. Going off of this proportion alone, it seems that there will be great difficulties trying to excute the mentorship program to the level that will be needed to compensate for the "silver tsumani".

### Additional Queries 
A query that will add insight to what is needed coming forward, would be to join the retiring_titles and mentorship_eligibility tables and then calculate the percentage of each title that is availible for the mentorship program. This will allow the company to plan ahead for recruitment purposes.

In a similar vein, comparing the number of retirees to the number of current workers employed under that title would illuminate the roles that are most vital to the company and would therefore require more attention.
